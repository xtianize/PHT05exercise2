            <h2>my current career</h2>
            <p>
              Hello, thanks for visiting my personal website. I'm currently
              working as an accounting officer for a company. My job involves
              bookkeeping, planning and sending purchase orders, receiving
              collection, and taking orders over the phone. In this job, I also
              gained experience and became proficient with clerical tasks such
              as data entry, word processing, excel and email handling. I’m
              doing fine with my current work but I also wish to pursue a career
              in IT industry. I’m a graduate of computer science, which is the
              reason why I find software development interesting.
            </p>

            <h2>my hobbies and interests</h2>
            <p>
              Aside from coding, these are the things that I enjoy spending my
              time with:

              <li class="liAbout">
                <strong>listening to music</strong> - during my free time, i
                listen to music to free my mind and appreciate the little things
                in life. You can checkout my apple music playlist at:

              <br />
              <li class="liAbout">
                <strong>playing guitar</strong> - as a music lover, playing
                instrument becomes a natural hobby. For me, there’s a difference
                between a record and an actual live music(I’m not a part of a
                band though). Live music is more engaging and you can hear the
                instruments in their purest form.
              </li>
              <br />
              <li class="liAbout">
                <strong>hiking</strong> - I'm also a nature lover. Even though
                I'm an introvert I enjoy hanging out with people with the same
                interests as me. Sometimes I join hiking events that fits my
                schedule and budget.
